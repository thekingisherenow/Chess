INITIAL SYSTEM DESIGN :


games = [ Game ]
so Game is an object

Game = {participant 1, 
	participant 2,
	state,
	moves([e4 t1,e5 t2]),
	startTime 
}



Whenever there is a move that reaches a server , 1. you need to do validations 2. you need to check if there is a check or a checkmate.

Not foolproof system because if the server ever dies , you loose all of the information and you lose everything that you had created in the memory and you canot recreate the game
