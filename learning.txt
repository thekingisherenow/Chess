So this websocket thing is cool. so the server creates a new web socket with 
each of the user and we save this socket to the array of web sockets ,i.e players

when we need to add a new player, we add that web socket to the players--

when we need to remove a socket- we remove it from the list of players..

when handling messages- we cmade it private because,, maybe we call it inside addPlayer like :

    function addPlayer(socket:WebSocket){
        socket.handleMessage(socket)
    }

-----------------

socket.on("message",(data)=> {
    
})  
=> the one method is set up event listener to a certain event--
